For this assignment, I incorporated the observer command, Singleton and factory design pattern to create a game where you control the actions of enemies after entering an area that they are occupying. For Singleton, I used this for the manager. for the observer pattern, I had the enemy behavior script and the game manager script, observing the detection script to see when the player entered the enemies area. For the command pattern, I have three different commands that determine the steering behaviors of the enemies. These commands are seeking, fleeing, and wandering. Finally for the factory design pattern, I have the enemies spawning randomly in the area of their zone using a factory script with an enemy spawner script.

The goal for this game project that I developed was to continue off of a project that I worked on last year, which was a recreation of a level in little nightmares 2. After seeing how the game played out, I realized that the scene itself didn’t really reflect the gameplay that I started setting up and ended up removing the original scene from the scene. It’s more just like a sandbox area where the players are able to interact with the enemies. The only aspect taken from my previous game was how the camera would function and the seeking of the play, which also behaves differently in this version.
